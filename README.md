Rusty Todo ðŸ”Š
---

This _Rusty todo_ terminal gui can be used for distance morning meetings, where one designated person keeps track of the attendees and is able to "pass the ball around the table".

It is basically a modified, emojified todo-list with a checkmark. One can add new entries (meeting members), delete them, and change the checkmark status based on who has spoken or not.

# Running
